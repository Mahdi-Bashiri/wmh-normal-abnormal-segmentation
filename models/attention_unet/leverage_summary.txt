    PERFORMANCE RESULTS:
    --------------------
    OVERLAP-BASED METRICS:
                            | Scenario 1 (Binary) | Scenario 2 (3-class) | Improvement
    --------------------|---------------------|----------------------|------------
    Accuracy            | 0.9844            | 0.9959             | +0.0115
    Precision           | 0.3236           | 0.7110            | +0.3874
    Recall              | 0.9769              | 0.7707               | -0.2062
    Specificity         | 0.9998         | 0.9983          | -0.0016
    Dice Coefficient    | 0.4861                | 0.7396                 | +0.2535

    SURFACE-BASED METRICS (lower is better):
                            | Scenario 1 (Binary) | Scenario 2 (3-class) | Improvement
    --------------------|---------------------|----------------------|------------
    HD95 (pixels)       | 52.3479 ± 41.1076 | 47.0514 ± 40.1375 | +5.2965
    ASSD (pixels)       | 11.1905 ± 12.0022 | 14.1671 ± 18.8798 | -2.9767

    Note: For HD95 and ASSD, positive improvement means reduction (better boundary accuracy)
    Valid samples: HD95=128/161, ASSD=128/161

    Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.4419
    95% Confidence Interval: [0.0927, 0.1798]
    Result: SIGNIFICANT improvement

    IoU COEFFICIENT:
    Test: Paired t-test
    t-statistic: 6.5713
    p-value: 0.0000
    Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.5197
    95% Confidence Interval: [0.0961, 0.1786]
    Result: SIGNIFICANT improvement

    HD95 (95th Percentile Hausdorff Distance):
    Test: Paired t-test
    t-statistic: 1.7275

    KEY FINDINGS:
    -------------
    OVERLAP-BASED METRICS:
    1. Three-class segmentation shows 43.87% improvement in Dice coefficient
    2. Three-class segmentation shows 63.30% improvement in IoU coefficient
    3. Dice improvement is statistically significant (p<0.05)
    4. IoU improvement is statistically significant (p<0.05)

    SURFACE-BASED METRICS:
    5. HD95 shows 10.12% reduction (lower is better)
    6. ASSD shows 26.60% increase (lower is better)
    7. HD95 improvement is not statistically significant
    8. ASSD improvement is statistically significant (p<0.05)

    OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
    9. Post-processing provided substantial improvements in both scenarios
    10. Three-class approach shows consistent advantages across multiple metrics
    11. Boundary accuracy (HD95/ASSD) improved significantly
