# wmh-normal-abnormal-segmentation
 Enhanced pathological WMH segmentation using multi-class deep learning. Novel three-class training approach explicitly models normal WMHs to improve pathological lesion detection. Evaluated on 4 architectures with 100 MS patients. Achieves 55.6% Dice improvement. Reduces false positives in periventricular regions.
